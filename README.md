## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**zubnik97/zubnik97** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
- Iâ€™m currently working on an on-site maintenance engineer for PCs, office equipment and cash registers.
- I am currently receiving higher education in the specialty (Networks and communication systems).
- I studied C++ in college, but due to lack of practice, my knowledge is gone.
- About me: An ordinary guy who is trying to develop and improve.
- There is nothing more to say.
